# Hey! I'm Nandu Sankar
## I am an aspiring Front-End Web Developer!

I've always had a passion for the creative and artistic side of technology and creating applications and websites that are pleasant to the eyes of the user.

I continue to uphold this objective in my work with the intention of the users having rich and lively experiences on their devices.

With additional relevant skills in UI / UX Design, I believe I can improve the way our users interact with our products and make our applications stand out from the crowd!
